# Lua Source Code Reading Notes
I have been interested in compiler & interpreter since long long time ago. 
I have read several books and many articals about compilter principle, eg the dragon book, sicp,
compiler in action and written many program, like nfa machine, lexer, parser. 
And I finished mini [assembly interpreter](https://github.com/robin1001/tvm) and 
[calculator compiler & interpreter](https://github.com/robin1001/calculator).
It's really an interesting work. Now I plan to read lua source code since it's
simple, fast, embeding but powerful language, and many people think highly of lua.
May me have a nice trip in reading lua.
